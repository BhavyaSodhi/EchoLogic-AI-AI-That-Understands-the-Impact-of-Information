EchoLogic AI – AI That Understands the Impact of Information is an intelligent simulation system designed to predict how long any piece of information—such as a post, news article, idea, or video—will remain relevant online and when public attention will begin to fade. Instead of focusing on emotions, medical data, or historical datasets, EchoLogic AI models the dynamics of digital attention using three integrated concepts: information lifespan prediction, attention decay modeling, and competition pressure analysis. It studies how content competes within an information ecosystem and estimates how external factors influence its survival time. The system answers critical questions like how long content will stay alive, when audience interest will decline, and whether it is strategically beneficial to publish at a given moment. By explaining the lifecycle of information rather than just predicting popularity, EchoLogic AI provides a scientific understanding of digital attention and content longevity.
